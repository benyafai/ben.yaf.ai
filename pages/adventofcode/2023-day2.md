### 2023 - Day 2

##### Cube Conundrum

---

Pulling dice from a bag and counting how many were red, green and blue.

Part one of [today's challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2) was to check if the game was possible, given limits of each colour that we could pull.

Here's an example line:

```
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
```

I first started with a simple regex to pull out the Game number, and the full round of games, then exploded out each round into an individual game.

With a little more regex to grab the numbers and colours more easily, I compared them to our max values and, if the game was possible, added the game ID up.

I used almost the same code for part two where instead of seeing if a game was possible, we counted the minimum number of dice to max sure the game *is* possible.

I reckon there must be some better regex I could have done earlier on - definitly not my string point.
I was glad I could re-use a bunch of the same code this time round though.
