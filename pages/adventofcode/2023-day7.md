### 2023 - Day 7

##### Camel Cards

---

[Today's challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7) is a simplified poker-like game where 5 cards get ranked by how many cards in each hand are the same. If two hands are ranked the same, then the hand with the highest card wins.

As ever, I regexed out my data from the input;
```
// Typically, we'll parse our data out with regex
preg_match('/(\w{5}) (\d+)/', $line, $filtered);
// And add them to an array
$games[] = [
    "hand" => $filtered[1],
    "bid" => $filtered[2],
];
```

I chucked together a quick array to get our card values
```
$cards = [
    "2" => 2, "3" => 3, "4" => 4, "5" => 5, "6" => 6, "7" => 7, "8" => 8,
    "9" => 9, "T" => 10, "J" => 11, "Q" => 12, "K" => 13, "A" => 14,
];
```

My first thought was that a `usort` was the way to go, here's the inline function

```
// Rank our games, give them a fixed value
$hands = [];
foreach([$a, $b] as $id => $play) {
    // Make life easier by converting all cards to number values
    $splitHand = str_split($play["hand"]);
    foreach ($splitHand as $c => $card) {
        $splitHand[$c] = $cards[$card];
    }
    
    // This is the special part
    $count = array_count_values($splitHand);
    arsort($count, SORT_NUMERIC);
    
    if (count($count) == 5) {
        // 5 cards means all are different
        $rank = 1; // High Card
    } elseif (count($count) == 4) {
        // 4 count means that only card is the same as another
        $rank = 2; // One Pair 
    } elseif (count($count) == 3) {
        if($count[array_key_first($count)] == 2) {
            $rank = 3; // Two Pair
        } else {
            $rank = 4; // Three of a kind
        }
    } elseif (count($count) == 2) {
        if($count[array_key_first($count)] == 3) {
            $rank = 5; // Full house (3 + 2
        } else {
            $rank = 6; // Four of a Kind
        }
    } elseif (count($count) == 1) {
        // All cards are the same
        $rank = 7; // Five of a kind
    }
    $hands[$id] = $play;
    $hands[$id]["rank"] = $rank;
    $hands[$id]["split"] = $splitHand;
}


// If the ranked value is the same, sort by Card value
if ($hands[0]["rank"] == $hands[1]["rank"]) {
    for ($x = 0; $x <= 4; $x++) {
        if ($hands[0]["split"][$x] > $hands[1]["split"][$x]) {
            return 1;
        } elseif ($hands[0]["split"][$x] < $hands[1]["split"][$x]) {
            return -1;
        }
    }
}

// Assuming we have different ranks, the highest wins
if ($hands[0]["rank"] > $hands[1]["rank"]) {
    return 1;
} elseif ($hands[0]["rank"] < $hands[1]["rank"]) {
    return -1;
}
return 0;
```

This was quite fun and relatively simple. The wide range of php array functions helped a lot.

Part two of course always makes it more complex. Now the Jack becomes a Joker wildcard that can be substitued for any other card, however, to balance it out, only has a score of 1 instead of the previous 11.

I updated the cards array for the new score

```
$cards = [
    "2" => 2, "3" => 3, "4" => 4, "5" => 5, "6" => 6, "7" => 7, "8" => 8,
    "9" => 9, "T" => 10, "J" => 1, "Q" => 12, "K" => 13, "A" => 14,
];                       ////////
```

I added a little bit of code into the middle of the sort in order to identify the cards and make our substitutions

```
// Because we now have the 'J' wildcard, and have converted score to 1...
if (isset($count[1])) {
    $numberOfJ = $count[1];
    $keys = array_keys($count);
    // If count == 1, then it must be all J, so do nothing, otherwise:
    if (count($count) > 1) {
        if ($keys[0] != 1) {
            $topResult = $keys[0];
        } else {
            $topResult = $keys[1];
        }
        // Remove our 'J's
        unset($count[1]);
        // And add them to our other top card
        $count[$topResult] += $numberOfJ;
    }
}
```

The first problem I had was unsetting a full hand of Jokers `JJJJJ` with nothing and producing errors - a quick find.

Then I got the wrong answer because I saw hands like `JJJJQ` which my code would see that the top result was 4xJ and wiuld try to replace the result exactly as it was, hence the `if ($keys[0]!= 1)` to make sure I wasn't updating the wrong card.
