Hi!

So late last year I [listed my subscriptions](/subscriptions-2023) here, and it drove me to actually do something about them.

This post will be largely the same, but I'll ~~strike through~~ the things that have changed.

### Apps

**[Ivory](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274)** (Â£14.99 per year)

After trying so many Mastodon apps, I keep bounce between this and the official Mastodon app.
Some of the smaller UI elements in Ivory stick out to me that keep me using it as my main app.

**[Carrot](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/carrot-weather-alerts-radar/id961390574)** (Â£8.99 per year)

I've been using this weather app for a number of years now, no issues, likely to be around for a while.

**[Overcast](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/overcast/id888422857)** (Â£8.99 per year)

I've come back to Overcast after a few years in Apple Podcast as my current car doesn't have CarPlay, so I have to do a lot more control by voice.

Overcast has much better Stations, where I can specify the shows and order to play them. Shortcuts integration is better too.

I'm months behind on my podcasts since I commuted less during covid, which was my main listening time. I'm catching up and Overcast makes it easier.

*Total = Â£32.97 per year ~ Â£2.75 per month*

### Gaming

**Apple Arcade** (Included below)

Very happy with this - when my youngest wants a game on the iPad it must come from Apple Arcade, I know it'll be a decent game with no adverts.

~~**Xbox Game Pass** (Â£12.99 per month)~~

I've cancelled the Game Pass, we just don't use it.

**Nintendo** (Â£32 per year)

The kids use it, but rarely. Can probably go too.

**NYT Games** (Â£3 every 4 weeks)

This is for me. I play the games daily, it's going nowhere.

*Total = Â£71 per year ~ Â£5.91 per month*

### Streaming

**Apple TV+** (Included below)

I like it, not the biggest library but generally all good quality.

**Netflix** (Â£23 per month)

How much?! I pay for the 4K, and my extended family took advantage of the extra profiles, but after the recent clampdown I was all but certain Netflix was going to go.
We do watch it, but not as often as a few years ago.

However, a family member has thrown some money at me to get the cheaper additional login, so it'll stay for a little bit until that expires, and I'll figure it out then.

**Disney+** (Â£79.90 per year)

Disney have a wide catalogue that I generally like. Star Wars and Marvel are loved by the kids, and I'm probably watching more TV series here than Netflix currently.

**Amazon Prime** (Â£95 per year)

TV and Movies are okay, but we like the delivery too. Kind of useful.

**Now TV Entertainment** (Â£3 per month)

Its days are numbered!

*Total = Â£486.9 per year ~ Â£40.58 per month*

### Reading

**Newsblur** (Â£19 per year)

Smart RSS reader that I've been subscribed for 10 years so far.

~~**Which?** (Â£9 per month)~~

As I mentioned last year, I don't need this anymore as the projects are done.

*Total = Â£19 per year ~ Â£1.58 per month*

### Email & Hosting

**Apple Premier One** (Â£36.95 per Month)

This includes iCloud storage for photos and device backups, Apple Music, Apple Arcade and Apple TV+, all are used regularly in my household.

It also includes Apple News+ and Apple Fitness+ but these aren't really used at all. I did check out pricing the individual components but it's better to keep them included.

This is shared with 4 other family members and considering the included services is a pretty fair price.

**Microsoft 365** (Â£80 per year)

I have a Family plan, as a bunch of us use office for school or home-based work, my wife and I use the extended OneDrive storage for iPhone photo backup too.

I also have a bunch of 365 exchange plans for extended family members too (partially paid by work so not included in these totals) and is our primary email service.
I don't use the custom domain in 365 Family as it's too restrictive.

I make good use of the shared mailboxes, they are great for younger family members who can have their own Apple ID, Xbox ID etc but the email can be accessed/managed by the parents.

When they get older, we'll license the mailbox, and they can login in themselves.

~~**[Proton Unlimited](https://pr.tn/ref/J59PBWW16J5G)** (10.32 per month)~~

**[SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io?slref=ben_subs_2024)** (Â£3.15 per month)

I mentioned that I like Proton a lot, but I really didn't use it.

Well, the functions I actually liked were mainly from Simplelogin, which I can subscribe to on its own for much less.

I now use it as the main MX records for all my secondary domains too, very useful.

**[omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/ben)** (Â£48 per year)
Cool domain, email forwarding, basic hosting, pastebin, Mastodon, IRC, statuslog... A whole bunch of services for a reasonable price.

I have a few different addresses with a number of years prepaid on each. It'll be around for a while!

**OCI** (~Â£2.40 per month)

I have a few servers here, hosting Mastodon, Matrix, this site, other sites, a whole bunch.

I've been taking advantage of the 'forever-free' tier and adding some extra bits on, so my costs are fairly low.

I used AWS before and compared the prices should the 'free' tier ever go away and it still worked out better in OCI, so I'm not too worried if anything changes.

**[Bunny CDN](https://bunny.net?ref=h39orov26k)** (Â£1 per month)

My sites don't get much traffic, so my usage is low. I don't need it but being so low cost, I like having it around.

This year, I actually moved all my DNS to Bunny too, as nice a system as DNSimple, but lower cost.

~~**[dnsimple](https://dnsimple.com/r/5207b788e976d5)** (Â£4.30 per month)~~

**Ionos** (Â£0 per month)

I have a single domain with Ionos now, but the hosting is gone at last!

*Total = Â£650 per year ~ Â£54.17 per month*

## Total

I'm happy to report that I spend Â£1259.87 a year, averaged out as Â£104.99 per month.

I'll have gained around Â£653.52 in yearly savings, assuming I keep things as they are for 2024, thanks to kind internet folk who encouraged me to actually look at my spending habits!

### Other notes

**1Password**

I have a free family plan as part of work subscription but would pay myself otherwise.

**Domains**

Not counted in the above, I have around ~~44~~ 40 domains, including some for me, my family members and their businesses - ~~Â£642 per year. Eek.~~

I've whittled down my domains to _only_ 40 and moved registrars. My new total is now Â£484 per year, saving Â£158 per year!
